# GliderADCP.jl — Implementation Plan

**A pure-Julia toolbox for processing Nortek AD2CP data from SeaExplorer and Slocum gliders
into absolute ocean velocity profiles.**

Status (2026-07-07): **all phases complete** (0–7; 273 tests) — see the roadmap table in
§8 for per-phase results. The GitHub repo and local clone are both renamed to
`GliderADCP.jl`. Remaining: v0.1.0 tag + General-registry registration, whenever desired.
This document is kept as the design record; user-facing documentation lives in `docs/`
— start with [docs/src/tutorial.md](docs/src/tutorial.md) for a full scientific
walkthrough of the pipeline.

Supporting research (all verified, on disk):

- [docs/reference_dataset.md](docs/reference_dataset.md) — sea064 M38 reference dataset inventory (first-hand)
- [docs/research/gliderad2cp_analysis.md](docs/research/gliderad2cp_analysis.md) — full pipeline spec of the Python shear implementation (+ run-captured ground truth)
- [docs/research/slocum_ad2cp_analysis.md](docs/research/slocum_ad2cp_analysis.md) — full pipeline spec of the Python inverse implementation
- [docs/research/literature.md](docs/research/literature.md) — verified annotated bibliography + synthesis
- [docs/research/formats_and_ecosystem.md](docs/research/formats_and_ecosystem.md) — .ad2cp binary format spec, MIDAS conventions, Julia ecosystem scan

## 1. Goal and guiding principles

Replace the current Python step in the user's glider workflow (jlglider's 2,900-line
`process_adcp.py`, a gliderad2cp derivative) with a documented, tested, registered Julia
package that:

1. **Implements multiple methods over one common trunk** — the lADCP-style *shear method*
   (gliderad2cp lineage) and the Visbeck *least-squares inverse* (Todd 2017 / Gradone 2023
   lineage) consume identical QC'd inputs, so methods can be compared apples-to-apples on
   the same mission. Neither Python package offers this today (gliderad2cp has no inverse;
   Slocum-AD2CP's shear method is broken).
2. **Builds from first principles** — every transform derives from the measurement model in
   §2, validated against the instrument's own factory matrices and reference outputs, not
   copied blind.
3. **Fixes known defects consciously** — both Python packages contain verified bugs (§3);
   we implement the physically correct behavior by default and keep *parity switches* so
   regression tests can still reproduce Python outputs bit-approximately.
4. **One layer at a time** — each phase lands a self-contained, tested layer with explicit
   acceptance criteria against real data (§8).
5. **Julia-native, no Python at runtime** — PythonCall appears only in gated
   cross-validation tests.

## 2. First principles

### 2.1 Measurement model

Each beam *i* measures the along-beam Doppler velocity of scatterers relative to the moving
glider:

```
b_i = e_i(t) · (u_ocean(z_cell) − u_glider(t)) + noise
```

where `e_i` is the beam unit vector in the earth frame (beam geometry rotated by heading/
pitch/roll). Per ping, 3 beams ⇒ 3 components of the **relative** velocity
`v_rel = u_ocean − u_glider` at each cell. The ocean and glider contributions are not
separable from one ping — that is the core underdetermination. Closures:

- **Vertical differencing (shear method):** `∂v_rel/∂z = ∂u_ocean/∂z` because `u_glider`
  is constant across cells within a ping. Integrate shear → baroclinic profile; add one
  reference velocity.
- **Joint inversion (inverse method):** solve for `u_ocean(z bins)` and `u_glider(pings)`
  simultaneously with constraints (§5.2).
- **References available:** DAC from navigation (GPS-fix minus dead-reckoned displacement
  over the submerged interval; accuracy 1–2 cm/s RMS, Gradone 2023 / Rudnick 2018);
  **bottom track** (direct `u_glider` over ground when in range — enabled in the M38
  reference data); surface GPS drift; flight-model through-water velocity (Merckelbach
  2010/2019; Todd 2017 uses it as an extra constraint).

### 2.2 Glider AD2CP geometry (verified from instrument config + Nortek docs)

Beams: 1 fwd θ=47.5°, 2 stbd θ=25°, 3 aft θ=47.5°, 4 port θ=25° (φ = 0/−90/180/+90).
Design intent: at flight pitch ≈ ∓17.5°, the fore (dive) or aft (climb) 47.5° beam plus
both 25° side beams all sit ≈30° from vertical — an effective symmetric 3-beam Janus array.

- **Beam selection:** dive (pitch<0): beams {1,2,4}; climb: beams {2,3,4}
  (Gradone 2023; mirrored appropriately for mounting orientation — gliderad2cp instead
  *synthesizes* the dropped beam via the zero-error-velocity condition, which is
  algebraically equivalent; we implement the direct 3×3 solve and test the equivalence).
- **beam→XYZ:** factory matrix from the netCDF `Config` group (rows X, Y, Z1, Z2;
  e.g. ±0.6782 = 1/(2 sin 47.5°), ±1.1831 = 1/(2 sin 25°), 0.74, 0.5518); analytic fallback.
- **XYZ→ENU:** `R = H(heading−90°)·P(pitch, roll)` with the Nortek matrix convention (both
  Python packages agree on P; validated numerically in tests). Down-looking mounts flip the
  Y and Z rows. Magnetic declination added to heading — **not set onboard in the reference
  mission**, so the package must supply it (user value or IGRF/WMM model).
- **Range gating (critical, undocumented in files):** Nortek firmware time-gates all four
  beams with a hard-coded nominal 25° slant and 1500 m/s when >2 beams ping: along-beam
  cell distance = reported `Velocity Range` / cos 25°. Vertical offset of a cell then uses
  the *actual* per-beam angle from vertical:
  `θ_eff = arccos(cos(θ_b ∓ pitch or roll)·cos(roll or pitch))` (per-beam formulas in the
  research docs). Slocum-AD2CP omits the 1/cos 25° factor — a documented discrepancy we
  resolve in favor of the Nortek-confirmed behavior (parity switch for regression).
- **Sound speed:** beam velocities scale linearly: `v_true = v_recorded · c_true/c_used`
  (Fischer & Visbeck 1993). M38 recorded with salinity misconfigured (38 vs ~35.05) —
  c error ≈ 4 m/s ≈ 0.3 % velocity bias; correct from CTD via TEOS-10 (GibbsSeaWater).

### 2.3 Platform data (SeaExplorer first)

`gli` navigation files carry `DeadReckoning` flag, NMEA positions, attitude, and
`Declination` column; DAC per dive = (first GPS fix − last DR position)/submerged duration.
Payload (`pld1`) carries CTD (sound speed, and density for flight model) and a real-time
AD2CP subset; the `$PNORI/S/C` ASCII stream duplicates configuration + per-cell data in
real time. Slocum ingestion (via the user's JLDBDReader.jl: `m_water_vx/vy`,
`m_gps_mag_var`, etc.) comes after the SeaExplorer path is validated.

## 3. What the Python implementations teach us

Full specs in the research docs. Decisions they drive:

| Aspect | gliderad2cp (shear) | Slocum-AD2CP (inverse) | GliderADCP.jl |
|---|---|---|---|
| QC defaults | corr≥80 %, amp≤80 dB & ≥floor+3 dB, \|v\|≤0.8 m/s | corr≥50 %, amp≤75 dB, \|ENU\|≤0.75, first bin, <5 m | all screens available, defaults per-mode, + sidelobe/ambiguity/BT-FOM (§6) |
| Declination | none (only manual heading_offset) | rotate DAC + heading by m_gps_mag_var | first-class: user value or IGRF, applied to heading and any magnetic-frame DAC |
| Cell depths | Range/cos 25° then per-beam θ_eff | per-beam θ_eff without the 25° un-projection | Nortek-confirmed behavior; parity switches |
| Regridding | isobaric offsets at cellSize/2 | interp onto VelocityRange as offsets | isobaric offset grid (explicit spacing & sign) |
| Reference | DAC via ADCP-as-DVL displacement | glider's own m_water_vx/vy | DAC from nav (SeaExplorer DR/GPS), DVL-style optional, BT, surface drift |
| Known defects | per-index shear scaling (exact only for down-looking 2-m cells), left-edge grid loss, bias-mask no-op | dive-matrix overwrite, rotation transpose, off-by-one bin drop, end-time as midpoint, index-aligned deployment grid | physically correct defaults + documented parity modes |
| Solver | cumsum integration | scipy lsqr, complex U+iV | explicit trapezoidal/cumsum (shear); Krylov lsqr/lsmr or SPQR (inverse), complex or stacked-real |

Both packages assume MIDAS netCDF input, use only 3 beams per cast direction, ignore W in
the horizontal solutions, and lack bottom-track support — the M38 dataset has BT data, so
we implement the BT constraint from day one (novel relative to both).

## 4. Package design

### 4.1 Identity & integration

- Module **`GliderADCP`**, repo renamed `GliderADCP.jl` (GitHub + local clone,
  2026-07-07). Julia ≥ 1.10 (LTS). MIT license (already present).
- Sibling, not monolith: Slocum I/O delegates to **JLDBDReader.jl**; SeaExplorer parsing
  conventions harvested from **jlglider** (eventually jlglider calls this package);
  package conventions modeled on **ATOMIXjulia.jl**.
- Deps (already resolved in Project.toml): NCDatasets, CSV, DataFrames, CodecZlib,
  Interpolations, GibbsSeaWater, NaNStatistics, Krylov + stdlibs. CairoMakie later as a
  package extension. PythonCall only under `test/` (CondaPkg.toml there), gated by
  `ADCP_CROSSVAL=1`.

### 4.2 Conventions (fixed now, documented in code)

- Depth positive down (m); cell *offsets* signed positive in the look direction.
- Velocities m/s, ENU with U(p) positive up; angles degrees at API boundaries, radians inside.
- Missing data = `NaN` inside numeric arrays (performance; `missing` only at I/O edges).
- Time: `DateTime` (UTC) in structs; Float64 Unix seconds for interpolation internals.
- Every product carries provenance attributes (package version, options used, input files,
  QC-rejection statistics).

### 4.3 Architecture (matches `src/` scaffold)

compare(prof_s, prof_i)                                     # method intercomparison report
```

## 5. The methods

### 5.1 Method A — shear (gliderad2cp lineage, corrected)

1. Per-ping ENU relative velocities on an isobaric offset grid (Layer 2).
2. Shear per ping: first differences over *physical* Δz of the offset grid (explicit signed
   spacing — fixes the per-index scaling defect; `parity=:gliderad2cp` reproduces it).
3. Grid shear into (depth × profile) bins: median (default) with count/std diagnostics;
   inclusive right-edge handling (fixes grid2d edge loss).
4. Integrate top-down per profile → zero-mean baroclinic profile.
5. Reference: time-in-bin-weighted DAC referencing (gliderad2cp semantics), or plain
   depth-average matching; optional near-bottom BT referencing where BT is valid.
6. Optional shear-bias diagnosis (regression of velocity-gradient vs through-water
   displacement, gliderad2cp process_bias semantics) — reported, opt-in correction.

### 5.2 Method B — inverse (Visbeck 2002; Todd 2017; Gradone 2023, corrected)

Per segment (dive, climb, yo, or arbitrary window), complex `m = [u_g(1..nt); u_o(1..nz)]`:

- Measurement rows: `u_o(bin of cell) − u_g(ping) = v_rel` — nearest-bin (+1/−1) by default,
  optional linear interpolation weights split across adjacent bins.
- Constraint blocks (composable, weighted, all optional):
  - `DacConstraint`: ocean-side (Σ dz·u_o/H = DAC, Gradone form) **or** platform-side
    (Σ u_g·Δt = GPS displacement, Visbeck form) — both provided; weight default 5.
  - `BottomTrackConstraint`: rows `u_g(ping) = −v_BT(ping)` for FOM-valid BT pings (strong
    weight) — new relative to both Python packages.
  - `SurfaceDriftConstraint`: near-surface `u_o` from GPS drift between fixes (optional).
  - `Smoothness`: second-difference on the ocean block (and optionally the glider block,
    sized correctly — fixes the nz×nt truncation defect); weight default 1.
- Solve: `Krylov.lsqr` (damped optional) or sparse QR; U+iV jointly (complex) with a
  stacked-real fallback. Report per-bin observation counts and formal uncertainties from
  the normal-equation diagonal (χ² scaled).
- Segment modes: per-yo (Gradone parity), per-cast, and whole-mission joint solve
  (Julia's sparse solvers make the ~10⁵–10⁶-row mission-scale problem tractable).

### 5.3 Method C — extensions (post-v1)

Flight-model through-water velocity (Merckelbach 2010/2019) as an additional constraint or
independent estimate + w_water product; ADCP-nearest-bin flight-model calibration
(Welch 2022); compass-error diagnosis (von Appen 2015 / pitch-binned ellipsoid fits as in
Slocum-AD2CP); EVR/phase-unwrapping for burst modes (Shcherbina 2018); DIVAnd section mapping.

## 6. QC catalogue (Layer 2; all composable masks with per-screen rejection stats)

| Screen | Default | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Correlation | ≥ 50 % (average mode); 80 % strict preset | Gradone 2023 / gliderad2cp |
| Amplitude high | ≤ 75 dB | Gradone 2023 |
| Amplitude low / SNR | ≥ noise floor (0.5th pct pooled) + 3 dB | gliderad2cp |
| Relative speed | \|v_beam\| ≤ 0.8 m/s (and \|ENU\| post-transform) | both |
| Ambiguity proximity | flag \|v_beam\| > 0.9·V_R (V_R from Config, 2.5 m/s for M38) | Nortek/Shcherbina |
| Side lobe | cut range > D_boundary·cos θ_beam per beam, using altimeter/BT distance or surface | RDI primer |
| Near-surface | glider depth ≤ 5 m mask (configurable) | Slocum-AD2CP |
| First cell(s) | drop n cells nearest transducer (default 1) | Slocum-AD2CP |
| Attitude | \|pitch−pitch_flight\|, \|roll\| limits (optional) | community practice |
| Status/Error bits | instrument error ≠ 0 → drop ping | Nortek |
| BT validity | FOM ≠ 65535 and distance in (blank, range) | Nortek BT record |

## 7. Validation strategy (multi-level, per layer)

1. **Unit/synthetic (every phase):** synthetic beam velocities from a prescribed
   `u_ocean(z)` + glider trajectory → recover inputs through each layer (rotations invert,
   shear integrates back, inverse recovers truth within noise); property tests for the
   3-beam ↔ beam-synthesis equivalence; checksum/format tests for readers.
2. **Instrument self-consistency (M38):** factory beam2xyz vs analytic; BT-derived
   `u_glider` vs inverse-estimated `u_g` on bottom-track segments; dive vs climb profile
   agreement; DAC closure (mean of solution vs nav DAC).
3. **Regression vs prior outputs (M38, `m38_processed/`):** ENU stage vs
   `M38_ADCP_QAQC_CoordTransformed.nc` (VelE/VelN/VelU; parity mode with Gradone
   conventions); per-yo inverse vs `absolute_ocean_vel.csv` (expect agreement up to their
   documented bugs; quantify each deviation).
4. **Cross-validation vs gliderad2cp (SEA055 sample, `validation/gliderad2cp_reference/`):**
   run-captured ground truth (DAC[1] = [−0.02708, +0.10196] m/s, etc.); optional live
   PythonCall comparison behind `ADCP_CROSSVAL=1`.
5. **Method intercomparison (the science check):** shear vs inverse vs BT on M38; target
   the literature accuracy class (few cm/s; DAC floor 1–2 cm/s).

## 8. Roadmap — one layer at a time

| Phase | Deliverable | Acceptance criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **0 — done** | research docs, dataset inventory, scaffold (compiles, tests pass) | this document |
| **1 — done (2026-07-06)** | `load_ad2cp` (Average + AverageBT + Config), SeaExplorer gli/pld parsers, core types | ✔ loads M38 (124,752 ensembles + 124,751 BT recs) & M48 sample; config matches docs/reference_dataset.md; nav parse: 103,150 records, 190 DR→GPS surfacing transitions (~191 yos) |

Slocum-convention parity vs `M38_ADCP_QAQC_CoordTransformed.nc` folded into Phase 4 regression |
| **3 — done (2026-07-06)** | `compute_dac` (SeaExplorer DR/GPS fix-to-fix), `surface_drift` | ✔ synthetic current recovered exactly; ✔ M38: 190/190 yos, median \|DAC\| = 0.16 m/s, 545 surface-drift pairs. DVL-style DAC (gliderad2cp) optional, deferred |
| **4 — core done (2026-07-06)** | `solve_shear` + `solve_inverse` (`invert_segment`) with composable DAC (:ocean/:platform), bottom-track and smoothness constraints; `bt_velocity`; `ProcessedPings` pipeline | ✔ synthetic truth recovered by both methods (incl. **BT-only absolute solution with no GPS reference**); ✔ BT sign convention verified on M38 (corr(w_bt, dP/dt) = 0.90); ✔ **independent M38 validation: DAC-only inverse glider velocities vs unseen bottom track r_v = 0.97, med \|Δ\| ≈ 7 cm/s (n = 807)**; ✔ regression vs `absolute_ocean_vel.csv`: 14 matched yos, median r_u = 0.83 (differences consistent with their documented transform defects). **Remaining:** dive/climb-consistency diagnostics, full-mission method-intercomparison report, declination (IGRF) → Phase 5 |
| **5 — core done (2026-07-07)** | IGRF declination (`magnetic_declination`), depth-matched section gridding (`grid_profiles`), provenance netCDF export (`export_sections`), full-mission example (`examples/currents.jl`) | ✔ end-to-end M38: 127 yos (matches the 126 in the prior processing), dive/climb r = 0.98 (med \|Δ\| 2 cm/s), DAC closure 5 mm/s, improved U/V section figures + exports. ✔ **Vertical-structure validation vs the prior Python output resolved in our favor** — raw-data tilt checks, BT-anchored deep velocities (1.6 cm/s), surface drift, and a permanent depth-varying end-to-end synthetic test (docs/research/m38_validation.md). **Done 2026-07-07 (block 2):** time-weighted DAC referencing (shear `referencing=:timeweighted` default + inverse `dac_form=:ocean_timeweighted`), `load_pnor` real-time stream parser (M38: r = 1.0 vs netCDF over 1530 matched ensembles), `slocum_nav`/`dac_from_slocum` (JLDBDReader/ERDDAP tables), Makie package extension (`plot_sections`), Aqua QA, GitHub Actions CI, Documenter scaffold |
| **6 — reader done (2026-07-07)** | `read_ad2cp` native binary reader (header scan + checksums + resync, DF3 average/burst, DF20 bottom track, embedded config-string parsing; `load_ad2cp` dispatches on `.ad2cp`) | ✔ **bit-identical to the MIDAS netCDF on M38**: all 124,752 ensembles (vel/amp/corr/attitude/sensors max Δ = 0) + 124,751 BT records (Δ = 0); config fully recovered; ~0.3 s for 54 MB; synthetic-binary unit tests cover resync + checksum rejection |
| **7 — done (2026-07-07)** | `calibrate_shear_bias!` (pairwise-difference track-frame calibration; M38 −4×10⁻⁴ s⁻¹ removed to machine zero, residual < 10⁻⁴ at all depths, inverse invariant); `vertical_velocity` (flight-model-free w = U_rel + dP/dt; M38: median −0.001 m/s, p90 2 cm/s); `compass_field_check` (M38: 2.5 % \|B\| heading variation — compass clean, eddy-yo outliers not compass artifacts); surface-velocity question investigated to closure (real quiet surface; segment-mean caveat — docs/research/m38_validation.md); DIVAnd section example (`examples/m38_divand_sections.jl`, masked by the analysis error field — no extrapolation beyond sampled coverage); `cell_quality` per-cell/beam ping-quality diagnostic (M38: effective range ~15–17 m of the configured 30 m; correlation-threshold sensitivity of the shear bias measured and documented); full documentation pass (`docs/src/tutorial.md`, `docs/src/index.md`, Documenter builds clean). **Deferred with rationale:** full Merckelbach flight model (the ADCP supersedes it for w and through-water velocity; revisit for AOA/performance studies), burst-mode EVR/phase-unwrapping (no burst data in any local mission; reader already parses 0x15 records), compass *correction* (diagnostic in place; correction is a research task and M38 doesn't need it), correlation-weighted inversion (noted as a future refinement in the tutorial) | per-feature |

Each phase = one PR-sized unit with its tests; no phase starts until the previous one's
acceptance criteria pass.

## 8a. Queued for next session (2026-07-08)

1. **Shear-only apples-to-apples comparison, as a product — DONE (2026-07-08).**
   Added `solve_shear_profile` + `inverse_shear` (tested on synthetic truth). M38
   finding (m38_validation.md §Task 1): per-yo bin-scale shear is internal-wave
   dominated — the direct product's own dive-vs-climb reproducibility is r = 0.08, so
   per-bin method agreement (r ≈ 0.2; 0.63 in the top 100 m) is at the sampling ceiling;
   mission-mean v-shear agrees, mission-mean u-shear exposes the calibration's
   absorption of track-aligned real shear (heading-diversity caveat quantified) — feeds
   Task 3.
2. **SeaExplorer loader duplication vs ATOMIXjulia.jl — DONE (2026-07-08).**
   Resolved by extracting **SeaExplorerIO.jl** (`/Users/gong/GitHub/SeaExplorerIO.jl`,
   GitHub `oceansensing/SeaExplorerIO.jl`): a dependency-minimal shared file layer
   (CodecZlib + Dates + OrderedCollections only) merging the best of both loaders —
   ATOMIXjulia's lean column-selective parser, GliderTable, schema guarantees and
   mixed-header alignment; GliderADCP's generic stream discovery, missing_segments
   transfer-gap detection, and NMEA conversion extended to payload coordinates. Both
   packages now wrap it with their historical APIs unchanged
   (`load_seaexplorer_nav`/`load_seaexplorer_pld` here return GliderNav/DataFrame as
   before; `read_gli`/`read_pld`/`GliderTable` re-exported there). Behavior change to
   note: `load_seaexplorer_pld` now converts `NAV_LATITUDE`/`NAV_LONGITUDE` from NMEA
   to decimal degrees (previously returned raw NMEA — a gap, now fixed), and payload
   columns are Float64-with-missing rather than CSV-inferred types. Test totals:
   SeaExplorerIO 63, GliderADCP 328, ATOMIXjulia 867 — all green; the `@ocean` stack
   loads all three together. Future loader fixes and new sensors (DO, fluorometer, …)
   land once, in SeaExplorerIO.

3. **Strong shear near 300 m — RESOLVED (2026-07-08): artifact of false bottom-track
   locks.** 99.7 % of M38's BT "fixes" were a near-field water-borne target ~1.7 m below
   the transducer (the seafloor was never in range); anchoring to it contradicted the
   DAC and injected the 300-m shear and the yos-8–18 outliers. Hydrography vetoes the
   feature (pycnocline at 160–260 m; thermal wind ~10⁻⁵ s⁻¹; Ri < ¼ otherwise).
   `bt_valid` hardened (min_range = 5 m + impossible-bathymetry screen, default-on);
   earlier BT-validation claims amended in `m38_validation.md` §Task 3; Task 1's
   mission-mean u-shear asymmetry traced to the same cause (calibration-absorption
   hypothesis retracted).

4. **Section figure fixes — DONE (2026-07-08).** Four-panel U/V (inverse + shear, both
   components), new `solve_w` product with `:direct` and `:inverse` (pressure-anchored)
   methods plotted as a two-panel w figure, data-driven 99th-percentile color ranges
   (M38: ±0.5 m/s horizontal, ±0.04 m/s vertical — no saturation). Side result of the
   Task-3 fix, documented in m38_validation.md §Task 4: shear-vs-inverse agreement is
   actually r ≈ 0.98 / rms 0.036 m/s (the previous 0.65/0.20 was measured against the
   BT-contaminated inverse); DAC closure 1 mm/s.

5. **Real-time vs delayed-mode comparison — DONE (2026-07-08).** Full pipeline run
   independently on the `$PNOR` telemetry stream (`load_pnor`) and the full-resolution
   `.ad2cp` binary, all shared inputs identical. M38: stream covers the whole main
   pinging period (99.4% of ensembles; payload stopped writing it 2022-11-27, binary
   adds only 750 late burst ensembles); both routes solve the identical 127 yos.
   Inverse agreement r=0.9996/0.9997 (u/v), rms 4.6/4.1 mm/s, zero bias, depth-uniform
   to 1000 m; shear method rms 2.3–2.5 cm/s (integration accumulates quantization
   noise); w rms 2.6 mm/s. A real-time product is essentially the delayed product for
   the inverse method. Details in docs/research/m38_validation.md §Task 5; script
   `examples/realtime_vs_delayed.jl`; gated 3-day acceptance test in the suite.
6. **Robust missing-data handling — DONE (2026-07-08).** All loaders skip
   corrupt/unreadable inputs with specific warnings (SeaExplorer per-segment, netCDF
   per-file, `$PNOR` per-file; binary reader already resynced and now also reports
   truncated tails); `missing_segments` detects transfer gaps; `magnetic_declination`
   constant-extrapolates outside nav coverage instead of silently dropping pings;
   solvers log solved-of-total summaries; new `coverage`/`data_gaps` structured
   reports (AD2CPData/GliderNav/ProcessedPings). Locked in by a robustness testset with
   deliberately corrupted gz/netCDF/binary/PNOR inputs, starved/empty segment tables,
   and coverage units; M38 acceptance: 72 gaps totalling 104 days (duty cycle) reported,
   nav segment sequence complete.

### 8b. Post-queue work (2026-07-08, later the same day)

All six §8a tasks closed, then:

1. **GLIMPSE-server route + multi-download dedup (SeaExplorerIO 0.2.x).** GLIMPSE
   `.all.csv` exports (YO_NUMBER column, ±9999 sentinels, version-dependent derived
   columns) read natively; readers accept vectors of directories and priority-ranked
   stream lists; `merge_tables` dedups by exact timestamp, highest resolution winning,
   columns coalesced. ±9999 sentinels parse to missing everywhere by default. Zero-row
   sources (unsynced cloud placeholders — seen in the wild on M38) warn. Both downstream
   packages migrated; acceptance on NESMA and M38 glimpse data.
2. **Three-mission workflow validation**, one mission-agnostic script over a shared
   registry (`examples/missions.jl` + `examples/currents.jl`): M37 Jan Mayen (genuine
   BT — 16 locks pass the same screens that reject all of M38's false ones); M38 Lofoten
   (numbers unchanged switching to native binary + multi-route loading); M59 NESMA
   (binary↔netCDF parity max |Δvel| = 0 on a third mission; Gulf Stream jet crossing;
   shear-bias slope an order of magnitude below the 2022 missions ⇒ config-dependent,
   measure per mission). Real-time vs delayed generalized over the same registry
   (`examples/realtime_vs_delayed.jl`): inverse = delayed to 3.2–5.1 mm/s, zero bias,
   on all four missions (M48 Jan Mayen 2023 added 2026-07-09 with one registry
   entry — genuine BT again, third bit-exact netCDF parity, 2023 bias slope
   −2.4×10⁻⁴ between the 2022/2024 values), amplitude-independent.
3. **Method verdict recorded** (validation doc §Method verdict; tutorial "Which
   method?" box): the inverse is the production method — mechanistic case
   (localization vs integration), with stated limits (shared DAC reference; independent
   -instrument validation still open; regularization caveat). Shear method retained as
   the standard second opinion / health metric.
4. **Consolidated QA/QC guide** (`docs/src/qaqc.md`, in the Documenter pages): all
   QA/QC findings — screening rates, effective range, false-BT anatomy and the
   plausibility check, per-mission bias calibration, compass, coverage/missing-data
   contract, sentinels, multi-route dedup, real-time stream QA, the five per-mission
   health metrics with validated values. Stale pre-Task-3 BT numbers in tutorial §8
   fixed (retracted r_v = 0.97 claim removed, closure updated to 1–2 mm/s).

5. **Shore-side real-time route (2026-07-11).** Distinguished the two real-time AD2CP
   routes: the `$PNOR` stream is payload-logged only (not transmitted); the Iridium
   route is the AD2CP subset inside `pld1.sub` (verified: one subsampled ensemble per
   ~30 s, MMDDYY instrument stamps, beam coords, cells 1–6, 0.01 m/s, no amp/corr/BT).
   New `load_pld_adcp` (multi-route, deduped) feeds the standard pipeline: M38
   shore-side inverse matches delayed at r = 0.977/0.978, rms 36/35 mm/s, zero bias,
   identical 127 yos (w is the casualty: r = 0.67 — subsampling aliases it). ALSEAMAR's
   proprietary GLIMPSE product from identical input: r = 0.80/0.82, rms 131/107 mm/s —
   the open pipeline is ~3× closer to the delayed truth. Example
   `examples/realtime_telemetered.jl`; 354 tests incl. gated M38 acceptance.

6. **First-cell verdict (2026-07-11).** The deliberate 0.7 m blanking makes cell 1
   clean on all four missions (full correlation, on-curve amplitude, no bias vs cell 2,
   ~1.5× per-sample noise); keeping it adds 12% of samples (1/6 of telemetered data)
   and improves the shear-vs-inverse health metric on every mission with closure and
   drift unchanged. `QCThresholds.first_cells` default flipped 1 → 0, with a `qc!`
   warning below 0.5 m blanking. Four-mission health range now r = 0.90–0.98 at
   30–63 mm/s; telemetered-vs-delayed improves to 33/31 mm/s (w r 0.67 → 0.71).

## 9. Risks & open questions

- **Attitude/sign conventions** are the classic failure mode: resolved by triple-checking
  every rotation against (i) the factory matrix, (ii) both Python parity modes, and
  (iii) BT ground truth (BT velocity must oppose glider motion).
- **Nortek 25° range-gating** is firmware-dependent and undocumented in files (pers.-comm.
  provenance) — verify empirically on M38 (bottom-distance vs BT distance consistency) and
  make the assumption explicit in options.
- **Declination model** — resolved (Phase 5): `magnetic_declination` uses IGRF via
  `SatelliteToolboxGeomagneticField.jl`, with a user-supplied scalar/vector still accepted
  everywhere it's consumed.
- **gliderad2cp JOSS review is ongoing** — track for algorithm changes; our parity targets
  pin to commit `7fbccaf`.
- **Slocum-AD2CP parity vs correctness**: m38_processed outputs embed that package's bugs;
  regression comparisons must model those deviations explicitly rather than chase equality.
- **Compass calibration correction** (beyond declination) is the largest unmodeled error
  term (von Appen 2015). Phase 7 added a *diagnostic* (`compass_field_check`) — M38's
  compass is clean (2.5 % field variation), so a deviation-correction algorithm remains
  unimplemented pending a mission that actually needs it.
